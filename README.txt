REQUIREMENTS
============
Python 2.6+ (not 3.x): http://www.python.org/download/
Pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
PyOpenGL: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html

Tested combinations:
Windows 7 x64, Python 2.7.3 (32-bit), pygame 1.9.1release, PyOpenGL 3.0.2b2
Ubuntu 10.04 x64, Python 2.6.5, pygame 1.9.1release, PyOpenGL 3.0.0

HOW TO RUN
==========

WINDOWS:

1) Install python, pygame and PyOpenGL

2) Run chimera.py

LINUX:

1) Ensure that you have the required libraries.

   Most recent Debian and Ubuntu machines come with python 2.6+.
   You can check what version of python you have by running 'python -V'.
   
   To install the rest:
    
     $ sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-opengl
     
   The install procedure will vary for other linux distributions.

2) Run 'python chimera.py'. 

MAC:

1) Install pygame and pyopengl. (OS X comes with Python)

2) You may be able to just do 'python chimera.py' at a terminal.
   
   If not, try this... (not tested since the switch to Pygame)

   If you are on Snow Leopard, from a bash shell in the same directory
   as this README.txt file:

     $ VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes python chimera.py

   Otherwise, if you are on Lion:

     $ arch -i386 /usr/bin/python2.6 chimera.py

   I have not tried earlier versions of OS X.
   
CONTROLS
========
F1 - Help
LEFT/RIGHT - Move
SPACE - Jump, or fly (if you are part eagle)
D - Dig (if you are part mole. use LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN to aim before digging.)
UP/DOWN - Swim (if you are part fish; everything else just floats)
R - Restart level
ESC - Quit game entirely

OTHER TIPS
============
If you have a screen that is smaller than the default size (3x magnification, ie 960x720)
you can modify the 'scale' value in config.ini to a smaller number, like 1 or 2.
This may also help remove graphics artifacts.
